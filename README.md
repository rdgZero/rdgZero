Hey!

I studied Electrical Engineering and I'm currently an Embedded Systems Engineer at [RVE.SOL](https://www.rvesol.com)

My main interests are audio and human interface devices.
As hobbies I play guitar and develop electronics projects under the name BALIR A.W. (which range from effects pedals/stompboxes to macro pads).

Available for collaborating in anything related to PCB Design.
